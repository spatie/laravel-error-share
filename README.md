Imagine that you’re working on a project locally and that you bump into an exception. You try to figure out what the problem is, but you’re unable to find a solution. In that case, you might want to ask a colleague for help. 

Instead of immediately start screen sharing with your colleague (or letting your colleague roll their chair to your desk if you work in office), it might be handy to just send a link to your colleague where he or she can see that exception in detail.
